# Draft 04 — NIST Standards for Quantum Computing and Algorithms  

> _“They don’t play the game, but they make sure everyone’s playing by the same rules.”_  

## Overview  
This document explores **NIST’s role as the global referee of standards** in the age of quantum computing — focusing on its **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** program, finalized **FIPS 203, 204, 205**, and upcoming **FIPS 206**.  

The paper examines:
- The **quantum threat (Y2Q)** and the “**harvest-now, decrypt-later**” risk.  
- NIST’s **evaluation and selection process** for quantum-resistant algorithms.  
- Detailed profiles of **ML-KEM (KYBER)**, **ML-DSA (Dilithium)**, **SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+)**, and **FN-DSA (FALCON)**.  
- The newly announced **HQC** as a diversification algorithm.  
- The timeline toward full standardization and migration readiness.  

## Why It Matters  
Quantum computing is not theoretical anymore — with Google’s **Willow Quantum Chip** showing verifiable quantum advantage, classical cryptography faces a countdown.  
NIST’s PQC standards provide the **roadmap for a secure quantum-resilient future**.

## Timeline  
- **July 2022:** Four PQC candidates announced  
- **Aug 2024:** Three PQC standards finalized (FIPS 203-205)  
- **Mar 2025:** HQC announced as backup algorithm  
- **Sept 2025:** 6th PQC Standardization Conference  
- **Late 2026 → 2027:** FALCON (FIPS 206) expected
